# Available Plugins

This library comes with a few ready-to-go plugins that can be imported separately.

While you can use them directly, you can also just take a look at them to see further examples of how to use any of the available options this library provides, or you can consider them as reference implementations that you can fork!

- [enabled](./plugins/enabled.md)
- [preventDefault](./plugins/preventDefault.md)
- [os](./plugins/os.md)
- [priority](./plugins/priority.md)
